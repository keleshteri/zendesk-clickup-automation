# Slack Handlers Module Map

## Overview
This folder contains event handlers that process incoming Slack events, commands, mentions, and workflow interactions. These handlers serve as the entry points for user interactions with the Slack bot.

## File Structure

### Core Files
- **`index.ts`** - Main export file for all handler modules
- **`slack-command-handler.ts`** - Processes slash commands and bot commands
- **`slack-mention-handler.ts`** - Handles @mentions and direct messages
- **`slack-workflow-handler.ts`** - Manages workflow steps and interactive components

## Component Relationships

```
handlers/
├── index.ts (exports all handlers)
├── slack-command-handler.ts (slash commands)
├── slack-mention-handler.ts (@mentions & DMs)
└── slack-workflow-handler.ts (workflows & interactions)
```

## Dependencies
- **Internal**: ../core, ../config, ../types, ../utils
- **External**: @slack/bolt, @slack/web-api
- **Project**: src/agents, src/services

## Usage Patterns
- Handlers are registered with the Slack app/bolt framework
- Each handler processes specific event types
- Handlers delegate business logic to service layers
- Response formatting is handled by message builders

## Key Responsibilities

### Command Handler
- Process slash commands (e.g., `/zendesk`, `/clickup`)
- Parse command arguments and parameters
- Route commands to appropriate services
- Handle command validation and error responses

### Mention Handler
- Detect and process @bot mentions
- Handle direct messages to the bot
- Parse natural language requests
- Route to NLP processing services

### Workflow Handler
- Process interactive components (buttons, modals)
- Handle workflow step completions
- Manage multi-step user interactions
- Process form submissions and selections

## Integration Points
- **Core Services**: Use API clients and message builders
- **Agents**: Route complex requests to multi-agent system
- **NLP Router**: Send natural language requests for processing
- **Notifications**: Trigger notification workflows
- **Security**: Validate user permissions and request authenticity

## Event Flow

```
Slack Event → Handler → Validation → Business Logic → Response
     ↓           ↓          ↓            ↓           ↓
  Socket/HTTP → Parse → Security → Services → Message Builder
```

## Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for unknown commands
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging and monitoring integration
- Fallback responses for service failures

## Performance Considerations
- Handlers should respond quickly (< 3 seconds)
- Long-running tasks should be queued
- Rate limiting for user interactions
- Efficient event routing and processing

## Security Notes
- All events must be validated for authenticity
- User permissions checked before processing
- Sensitive data should not be logged
- Command injection prevention
