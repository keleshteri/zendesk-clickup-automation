# Slack Threads Module Map

## Overview
This folder contains components for managing Slack thread operations, including thread analysis, building, context management, and overall thread lifecycle management. It enables organized conversations and maintains context across related messages.

## File Structure

### Core Files
- **`index.ts`** - Main export file for all thread modules
- **`slack-thread-analyzer.ts`** - Analyzes thread content and patterns
- **`slack-thread-builder.ts`** - Constructs and manages thread structures
- **`slack-thread-context.ts`** - Maintains thread context and state
- **`slack-thread-manager.ts`** - Orchestrates thread operations and lifecycle

## Component Relationships

```

├── index.ts (exports all thread modules)
├── slack-thread-analyzer.ts (content analysis)
├── slack-thread-builder.ts (thread construction)
├── slack-thread-context.ts (context management)
└── slack-thread-manager.ts (lifecycle orchestration)

## Dependencies
- **Internal**: ../core, ../config, ../types, ../utils
- **External**: @slack/web-api, @slack/types
- **Project**: src/services, src/agents, src/types

## Usage Patterns
- Manager orchestrates all thread operations
- Analyzer processes thread content for insights
- Builder creates structured thread responses
- Context maintains conversation state

## Key Responsibilities

### Thread Analyzer
- Parse thread messages and extract key information
- Identify conversation patterns and topics
- Analyze user sentiment and intent
- Extract actionable items and decisions
- Generate thread summaries and insights

### Thread Builder
- Create threaded responses to messages
- Build structured conversation flows
- Manage reply chains and branching
- Format threaded notifications
- Handle thread-specific message formatting

### Thread Context
- Maintain conversation state across messages
- Track thread participants and roles
- Store thread metadata and history
- Manage context switching between threads
- Preserve conversation continuity

### Thread Manager
- Orchestrate thread creation and management
- Handle thread lifecycle events
- Coordinate between analyzer, builder, and context
- Manage thread archival and cleanup
- Implement thread-based workflows

## Integration Points
- **Handlers**: Process threaded events and commands
- **Notifications**: Send threaded updates and alerts
- **Agents**: Maintain context for multi-agent conversations
- **Zendesk/ClickUp**: Thread ticket and task discussions
- **Core API**: Thread message delivery and retrieval

## Thread Types

### Support Threads
- Ticket discussion threads
- Issue resolution conversations
- Customer support interactions

### Project Threads
- Task discussion threads
- Project update conversations
- Team collaboration threads

### System Threads
- Automated update threads
- Status monitoring conversations
- Alert and notification threads

## Context Management

```
Thread Context:
├── Thread ID and metadata
├── Participant list and roles
├── Conversation history
├── Related tickets/tasks
├── Current state and status
└── Action items and decisions
```

## Analysis Capabilities
- Message sentiment analysis
- Topic extraction and categorization
- Action item identification
- Decision point detection
- Conversation flow analysis

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient thread history retrieval
- Context caching for active threads
- Batch processing for thread analysis
- Optimized message threading

## Security and Privacy
- Thread access control
- Sensitive information handling
- Context isolation between threads
- Audit trail for thread operations

## Testing Coverage
- Unit tests for all thread modules
- Integration tests for thread workflows
- Performance tests for large threads
- Context persistence testing
