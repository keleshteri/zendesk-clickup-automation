## Routing Strategies

### Round Robin Routing
```typescript
class RoundRobinRouter {
  private currentIndex = 0;
  
  selectAgent(agents: Agent[], request: Request): Agent {
    const availableAgents = agents.filter(agent => agent.isAvailable());
    const selectedAgent = availableAgents[this.currentIndex % availableAgents.length];
    this.currentIndex++;
    return selectedAgent;
  }
}
```

### Capability-Based Routing
```typescript
class CapabilityRouter {
  selectAgent(agents: Agent[], request: Request): Agent {
    const scores = agents.map(agent => ({
      agent,
      score: this.calculateCompatibilityScore(agent, request)
    }));
    
    return scores
      .sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)
      .filter(item => item.score > 0.7)[0]?.agent;
  }
}
```

### Load-Based Routing
```typescript
class LoadBasedRouter {
  selectAgent(agents: Agent[], request: Request): Agent {
    return agents
      .filter(agent => agent.isAvailable())
      .sort((a, b) => a.getCurrentLoad() - b.getCurrentLoad())[0];
  }
}
```

### Weighted Routing
```typescript
class WeightedRouter {
  selectAgent(agents: Agent[], request: Request): Agent {
    const totalWeight = agents.reduce((sum, agent) => sum + agent.weight, 0);
    const random = Math.random() * totalWeight;
    
    let currentWeight = 0;
    for (const agent of agents) {
      currentWeight += agent.weight;
      if (random <= currentWeight && agent.isAvailable()) {
        return agent;
      }
    }
    
    return agents.find(agent => agent.isAvailable());
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Routing Setup
```typescript
const router = new AgentRouter({
  strategy: 'capability-based',
  loadBalancing: true,
  failoverEnabled: true,
  healthCheckInterval: 30000
});

// Register agents
router.registerAgent(businessAnalystAgent);
router.registerAgent(softwareEngineerAgent);
router.registerAgent(qaTesterAgent);

// Route request
const request = {
  type: 'code-review',
  priority: 'high',
  requirements: ['javascript', 'security-review'],
  deadline: '2024-01-15'

const selectedAgent = await router.routeRequest(request);
```

    healthCheckInterval: 15000,
    maxRetries: 3
  },
  prioritization: {
    enabled: true,
    levels: ['critical', 'high', 'medium', 'low'],
    queueManagement: 'priority-queue'
  }
});
```

### Custom Routing Rules
```typescript
router.addCustomRule({
  name: 'urgent-security-issues',
  condition: (request) => 
    request.priority === 'critical' && 
    request.tags.includes('security'),
  action: (agents) => 
    agents.filter(agent => 
      agent.capabilities.includes('security-expert')
    )[0]
});
