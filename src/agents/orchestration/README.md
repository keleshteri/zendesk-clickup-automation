# Workflow Management ðŸŽ­

This directory contains the orchestration layer that manages agent workflows, coordination, and execution sequences.

## Purpose

The `orchestration` directory provides:
- Workflow definition and execution engines
- Agent coordination and sequencing
- Task distribution and load balancing
- Workflow state management
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms

## Key Components

### Workflow Engine
- **WorkflowOrchestrator**: Main orchestration engine
- **WorkflowDefinition**: Defines workflow steps and dependencies
- **ExecutionContext**: Manages workflow execution state
- **StepExecutor**: Executes individual workflow steps

### Coordination
- **AgentCoordinator**: Manages agent interactions and dependencies
- **TaskScheduler**: Schedules and prioritizes agent tasks
- **ResourceManager**: Manages shared resources and conflicts
- **SyncManager**: Coordinates synchronous operations

### State Management
- **WorkflowState**: Tracks workflow execution progress
- **CheckpointManager**: Creates and manages workflow checkpoints
- **RecoveryManager**: Handles workflow recovery from failures

## Workflow Types

### Synchronization Workflows
- **TicketSyncWorkflow**: Syncs tickets between Zendesk and ClickUp
- **ProjectSyncWorkflow**: Syncs project data and updates
- **UserSyncWorkflow**: Manages user data synchronization

### Processing Workflows
- **TicketProcessingWorkflow**: End-to-end ticket processing
- **ReportGenerationWorkflow**: Automated report generation
- **MaintenanceWorkflow**: System maintenance and cleanup

## Usage

```typescript
import { WorkflowOrchestrator } from './WorkflowOrchestrator';
import { TicketSyncWorkflow } from './workflows/TicketSyncWorkflow';

const orchestrator = new WorkflowOrchestrator();
const workflow = new TicketSyncWorkflow();

await orchestrator.execute(workflow, context);
```

## Features

- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple agents concurrently
- **Dependency Management**: Handle agent dependencies automatically
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry and fallback mechanisms
- **Monitoring**: Real-time workflow monitoring and logging
- **Scalability**: Dynamic scaling based on workload
