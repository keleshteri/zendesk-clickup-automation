# AI Planning & Reasoning ðŸ§ 

This directory contains the AI-powered planning and reasoning capabilities for intelligent agent decision-making and task planning.

## Purpose

The `planning` directory provides:
- AI-driven task planning and scheduling
- Intelligent decision-making algorithms
- Goal-oriented planning systems
- Reasoning engines for complex scenarios
- Adaptive planning based on context and feedback

## Key Components

### Planning Engines
- **TaskPlanner**: Creates optimal task execution plans
- **GoalPlanner**: Plans sequences to achieve specific goals
- **ResourcePlanner**: Optimizes resource allocation and usage
- **SchedulePlanner**: Creates time-based execution schedules

### Reasoning Systems
- **DecisionEngine**: Makes intelligent decisions based on context
- **RuleEngine**: Applies business rules and constraints
- **InferenceEngine**: Performs logical inference and deduction
- **ContextAnalyzer**: Analyzes situational context for planning

### AI Integration
- **LLMPlanner**: Leverages large language models for planning
- **MLPredictor**: Uses machine learning for outcome prediction
- **PatternRecognizer**: Identifies patterns in data and behavior
- **AdaptiveLearner**: Learns from past executions to improve planning

## Planning Strategies

### Hierarchical Planning
- **HighLevelPlanner**: Creates abstract, high-level plans
- **DetailedPlanner**: Breaks down high-level plans into specific tasks
- **SubgoalPlanner**: Manages intermediate goals and milestones

### Dynamic Planning
- **ReactivePlanner**: Adapts plans based on real-time changes
- **ContinuousPlanner**: Continuously refines and optimizes plans
- **FallbackPlanner**: Creates backup plans for failure scenarios

### Optimization
- **EfficiencyOptimizer**: Optimizes for speed and resource usage
- **QualityOptimizer**: Optimizes for output quality and accuracy
- **CostOptimizer**: Minimizes operational costs and overhead

## Use Cases

### Ticket Management Planning
- **TicketPrioritization**: Intelligently prioritize tickets based on multiple factors
- **AssignmentPlanning**: Optimal assignment of tickets to team members
- **EscalationPlanning**: Plan escalation paths for complex issues

### Project Planning
- **ProjectScheduling**: Create optimal project timelines and milestones
- **ResourceAllocation**: Plan resource distribution across projects
- **DependencyPlanning**: Manage task dependencies and critical paths

### Synchronization Planning
- **SyncStrategy**: Plan optimal synchronization strategies
- **ConflictResolution**: Plan resolution for data conflicts
- **BatchPlanning**: Optimize batch processing schedules

## Usage

```typescript
import { TaskPlanner } from './TaskPlanner';
import { DecisionEngine } from './DecisionEngine';

// Create a task plan
const planner = new TaskPlanner();
const plan = await planner.createPlan({
  goal: 'sync_tickets',
  constraints: { maxTime: 3600, priority: 'high' },
  resources: ['zendesk-agent', 'clickup-agent']
});

// Make intelligent decisions
const decisionEngine = new DecisionEngine();
const decision = await decisionEngine.decide({
  context: 'ticket_assignment',
  options: ['agent_a', 'agent_b', 'escalate'],
  criteria: ['workload', 'expertise', 'availability']
});
```

## Features

- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Balance multiple competing objectives
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Respect business rules and limitations
- **Uncertainty Handling**: Plan under uncertainty and incomplete information
- **Learning and Adaptation**: Improve planning based on historical data
- **Explainable AI**: Provide reasoning behind planning decisions
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Adjust plans dynamically as conditions change
