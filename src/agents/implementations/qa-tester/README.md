  requirements: ['REQ-001', 'REQ-002', 'REQ-003'],
  testTypes: ['functional', 'integration', 'performance'],
  timeline: '4 weeks'
});

// Generate test cases
const testCases = await qaTester.generateTestCases({
  planId: testPlan.id,
  coverage: 'comprehensive',
  priority: 'high'
});
```

### Test Execution
```typescript
// Execute test suite
const execution = await qaTester.executeTests({
  testSuiteId: 'integration-tests',
  environment: 'staging',
  parallel: true
});

// Run automated tests
const automatedResults = await qaTester.runAutomatedTests({
  framework: 'selenium',
  browser: 'chrome',
  headless: true
});
```

### Defect Management
```typescript
// Report defect
const defect = await qaTester.reportDefect({
  title: 'Ticket sync fails with special characters',
  severity: 'high',
  priority: 'urgent',
  steps: ['Create ticket with special chars', 'Trigger sync', 'Check ClickUp'],
  expected: 'Ticket synced successfully',
  actual: 'Sync fails with error'
});

// Track defect resolution
const status = await qaTester.trackDefect(defect.id);
