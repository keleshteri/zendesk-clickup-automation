  granularity: 'task-level'
});
```

### Resource Management
```typescript
// Allocate team resources
const allocation = await projectManager.allocateResources({
  projectId: project.id,
  requirements: {

    'backend-developer': 2,
    'qa-tester': 1
  },
  constraints: {
    availability: 'full-time',
    duration: '12 weeks'
  }
});

// Optimize resource utilization
const optimization = await projectManager.optimizeResources({
  projects: [project.id],
  objectives: ['minimize-cost', 'maximize-efficiency']
});
```

### Progress Monitoring
```typescript
// Track project progress
const progress = await projectManager.trackProgress(project.id);
