  provider: 'aws',
  environment: 'production',
  specifications: {
    compute: { instances: 3, type: 't3.medium' },
    storage: { size: '100GB', type: 'ssd' },
    network: { vpc: true, subnets: 2 }
  }
});

// Apply configuration management
const config = await devopsAgent.applyConfiguration(infrastructure.id, {
  configType: 'ansible',
  playbooks: ['web-server', 'database', 'monitoring']
});
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Management
```typescript
// Execute deployment pipeline
const deployment = await devopsAgent.executePipeline({
  repository: 'zendesk-clickup-automation',
  branch: 'main',
  environment: 'staging',
  strategy: 'blue-green'
});

// Monitor deployment status
const status = await devopsAgent.monitorDeployment(deployment.id);
```

### System Monitoring
```typescript
// Setup monitoring and alerting
const monitoring = await devopsAgent.setupMonitoring({
  targets: ['web-servers', 'databases', 'load-balancers'],
  metrics: ['cpu', 'memory', 'disk', 'network'],
  alertThresholds: {
    cpu: 80,
    memory: 85,
    disk: 90
  }
});

// Generate performance report
const report = await devopsAgent.generatePerformanceReport({
  timeframe: '24h',
  services: ['api', 'database', 'cache']
});
```
