## Testing

### Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/
```

### Environment Test
```bash
curl https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/test
```

### Webhook Test
```bash
# Test Zendesk webhook (will create actual ClickUp task)
curl -X POST https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/zendesk-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "ticket.created",
    "ticket": {
      "id": 12345,
      "subject": "Test ticket from API",
